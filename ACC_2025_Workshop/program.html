<h3>Co-design of Data-driven Wireless Networked Control Systems</h3>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The efficiency of control systems that operate over shared communication networks closely
relates to the network’s ability to deliver services and allocate resources. Cellular network technologies,
such as 5G and 6G, offer customized services for diverse network needs. Given the strict real-time control
requirements and safety specifications of many emerging applications, there is a demand for adaptable,
control-aware network services. This insight points towards a combined design of both physical and network
layers with the control laws, to guarantee that the required quality-of-service matches the intended quality-
of-control. However, achieving an optimal combined design is tricky due to the interdependencies between
layers, where the design necessarily hinges also on the amount of shared information in the system. In
this talk, we will discuss how to formulate and solve such co-design problems. We will illustrate the
results through examples from vehicular and traffic control, showing how data-driven learning and control
can be integrated in a systematic way for future intelligent transport systems based on connected and
automated vehicles. The presented results have been developed together with students, postdocs and
industrial collaborators.

<h3>Intricacies of Information Structures in Stochastic Dynamic Games</h3>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The talk will cover, in both continuous time and discrete time, the issue of certainty equiva-
lence in two-player stochastic differential<i>dynamic games, first in the zero-sum framework and when the
players have access to state information through a common noisy measurement channel. For the discrete-
time case, the channel is also allowed to fail sporadically according to an independent Bernoulli process,
leading to intermittent loss of measurements, where the players are allowed to observe past realizations
of this process. It will be shown, first for a special class of parametrized games, that there would be
saddle-point equilibria (SPE) of both certainty-equivalent (CE) and non-CE types, and for the latter the
SPE involves mixed strategies by the maximizer. The insight provided by the analysis of this class of
games will be used to obtain through an indirect approach SPE for three classes of stochastic differen-
tial</i>dynamic games: (i) linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) zero- sum differential games with common noisy
measurements, (ii) discrete-time LQG zero-sum dynamic games with common noisy measurements, and
(iii) discrete-time LQG zero-sum dynamic games with intermittently missing perfect state measurements.
In all cases CE is a generalized notion, requiring two separate filters for the players, even though they
have a common communication channel. Discussions on extensions to other classes of stochastic games,
including nonzero-sum stochastic dynamic games, and on the challenges that lie ahead will conclude the
talk.

<h3>Multi-Robot Systems under Uncertainty: Balancing Communication Constraints and Task Satisfaction</h3>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Today's grand challenges, such as exploring ocean depths, navigating remote wilderness areas, and venturing into outer space, require the application of autonomous technologies in inaccessible and extreme environments. These conditions significantly impact the sensing, communication, and decision-making capabilities of robots. Multi-robot systems present promising solutions as both de-risking strategies with additional spatial-temporal capabilities in data collection and complex tasks delivery. Effective communication is essential for coordinating multiple robots. Much of the progress to date has assumed universally available and reliable communication, which is often untrue, particularly in high-uncertainty environments. As a result, robots face difficulties in regaining or enhancing communication while simultaneously completing their tasks. This talk explores resilient strategies for multi-robot systems that balance and integrate communication persistence with task planning. It highlights how robots use local decision-making to maintain intermittent connectivity while addressing complex tasks, as well as incorporating user preferences for efficient, near-optimal trajectory generation.

<h3>Policy Gradient Method over the Input-Output History Model</h3>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>In this talk, we will discuss a policy gradient method (PGM) over the so-called input-output history (IOH) representation and its application to the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) dynamic output feedback control synthesis. First, we establish the equivalence between the dynamic output feedback and the static partial state feedback under a new system representation characterized by the finite-length IOH. Using this equivalence, we search for the optimal dynamic output feedback controller via the search for the optimal partial state feedback gain. Due to the sparsity constraint on the feedback gain matrix, the latter problem belongs to the class of static output feedback design problems, which by itself is a well-recognized challenging problem. Nevertheless, by exploring a low-dimensional representation of the closed-loop system, we show that the cost function is smooth and exhibits a gradient dominance property under a few mild conditions, ensuring linear convergence of the PGM to the global optimum. This is a joint work with Dr. Tomonori Sadamoto.

<h3>Reinforcement Learning Across Realistic Communication Channels</h3>
<h3>Abstract </h3>
<p>Federated and distributed reinforcement learning have both been proposed to reduce the data hunger of traditional reinforcement learning algorithms. However, as we know from traditional distributed and networked control literature, constraints on information availability and sharing data across realistic communication channels can affect the stability and performance of the closed loop significantly. We consider such effects in reinforcement learning. We show that information patterns known to be tractable in traditional distributed control, such as partially nested patterns, continue to be tractable in reinforcement learning. On the other hand, while, in general, imperfect communication degrades the performance of RL algorithms, we also establish (perhaps surprisingly) that under suitable conditions on the channel, one can design coding schemes that incur no loss in performance.

<h3>Interaction-Aware Control and Planning in Autonomous Networked Systems</h3>
<h3>Abstract </h3>
<p>Performance of control and planning policies for autonomous networked systems is tightly coupled with both quality and type of information being exchanged among distributed components. While the quality of information exchange relates to how accurately the communication network transports data; determining the proper type of data to exchange requires analysing the relevance and value of information with respect to the desired objective. This is especially challenging when the information exchange pattern is dynamic, meaning that the components communicating with each other are not fixed a priori and communicating nodes may change over time. This is common in scenarios such as autonomous driving, where communication with other vehicles and infrastructure occurs based on location and physical interactions. Therefore, efficient control and planning requires two aspects to be properly considered: first, identifying the relevant interaction pattern, and second, ensuring information is transported with sufficient communication quality. In this talk, I will discuss the effects of properly designing both mentioned schemes on the control and planning performance for autonomous systems. Through high-fidelity simulations in an autonomous leader-follower vehicle network scenario, we show that proper interaction design results in noticeable control and planning performance improvement, even under harsh conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate that control-aware communication can provide required quality of service for critical control applications.

<h3>Quantized Insights: Unveiling the Impact of Limited Bandwidth on Koopman-Based Identification and Control </h3>
<h3>Abstract </h3>
<p>Koopman-based data-driven algorithms, such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), have gained popularity over the past decade as system identification techniques for model predictive control (MPC). However, these methods implicitly assume high-quality data for training, which may not be feasible in many real-world scenarios. For instance, an unmanned micro-air vehicle (UMAV) mapping its environment may transmit sensor data to an edge server, where system identification and learning occur. This data transmission can be affected by bandwidth constraints, channel noise, and packet loss. In this talk, we investigate the impact of bandwidth constraints, specifically quantization, on the identification and learning processes using Koopman-based methods. We will explore the fundamental relationship between estimates of the Koopman operator derived from unquantized data and those obtained from quantized data through DMD/EDMD. Furthermore, utilizing the law of large numbers, we demonstrate that, in a large data regime, the quantized estimate can be regarded as a regularized version of the unquantized estimate. We also examine the relationship between the two estimates in the finite data regime and analyze how nonlinear lifting functions influence this regularization due to quantization. Additionally, we demonstrate how the performance of data-driven MPC deteriorates as a result of quantization in controlled dynamical systems with an application in aerial robotics. This is a joint work with Dr. Dipankar Maity.
