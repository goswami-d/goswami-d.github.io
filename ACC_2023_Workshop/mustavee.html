<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Traffic is a human-engineered system that shows a wide range of characteristics. There are primarily two types of traffic systems- highways and urban arterials. Traffic behavior in highways and urban arterials is primarily stochastic because it depends on various random factors such as human-driver interactions, weather, road condition, road design, etc. Although it is observed that variables of traffic systems, i.e., speed, flow, density, queue length, travel time, etc., exhibit some periodic and chaotic patterns, there is no single underlying governing law that can explain all the phenomena observed in urban arterials and highways. Besides, traffic systems modeling involves multiscale modeling, meaning there are microscopic, macroscopic, and mesoscopic versions of traffic models. Therefore, modeling traffic systems is a challenging task. In recent years, data-driven techniques such as machine learning and deep learning have gained huge popularity in traffic system modeling due to the increase in computation power and data availability. Deep learning models are considered state-of-the-art because they succeed in a wide range of traffic phenomena prediction. But there are a few shortcomings of this approach. For example, deep learning models are not often explicable and generalizable. Hence, the blind application of deep learning is not encouraged in traffic management. To encounter the challenges, data-driven dynamical systems theory is emerging as a useful means because the approach provides a mathematical structure to the system without requiring explicit assumptions. In this presentation, we will explore a few dynamical systems aspects of traffic systems modeling.
